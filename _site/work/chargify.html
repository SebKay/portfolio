    The Brief
</h2>


<p>I was really happy when Chargify’s director of marketing asked me to work with them to get what they had to the next level.</p>

<p>After a call over Skype, we talked about what they had and where to take it. They had a base for the new site and knew what they wanted, so it was my job get them there using my skills as both a designer and developer.</p>

<p>After the Skype call, we got to work on a Trello board to keep track of all the work. The main things we tracked were items <strong>to-do</strong>, <strong>in-progress</strong>, <strong>completed</strong> and <strong>nice to haves</strong> (which were things we wanted, but weren’t essential to the project).</p>

<h2 class="h3">
    What I Did
</h2>


<p>The first order of business, after organising all current tasks and goals in Trello, was to take stock of what was already in place. There had been a developer who made a start, but didn’t get them all the way.</p>

<p>Over the last six months, I’ve worked closely with a few of the guys at Chargify to primarily do two things, rework their site from the ground up and make it responsive.</p>

<p>The Chargify site gets a lot of traffic, with a large amount of new customers signing up everyday, so a lot of care was taken to make the experience of using the site painless as possible.</p>

    </div>
</div>




<h2 class="h3">
    The Result
</h2>


<p>The new site is now mobile friendly, optimised to handle new sign ups and instills trust in a worthwhile brand.</p>

<p>I’ve heard from the marketing team that things have done nothing but increase since the new site went live, and the whole team loved it when they got a peek.</p>

<p>I’ve really enjoyed my time working with Chargify, and hope to continue working with them long into the future.</p>

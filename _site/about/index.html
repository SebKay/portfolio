    My Background
</h2>


<p>My name's Seb and I make websites. I've been designing and coding on the web since I was 13 years old, which was over 10 years ago.</p>

<p>My first experience with HTML and CSS was when I used to visit the official Stargate website for the latest news (I was a nerd before I was nerd by the looks of it). Whilst browsing the site I wanted to figure out how it was made, mainly because I wanted to make my own fan-site.</p>

<p>Over the next 6 months or so I built a variety of websites, mostly fan-sites for my favourite TV shows and movies and steadily gained enough experience to start building websites for people I knew.</p>

<p>Growing up I loved discovering new ways of making new things on the web using HTML and CSS. Eventually that lead me into building fully-fledged websites and eventually taking on client work.</p>

    What I Do
</h2>


<p>When it comes down to it sketch, design and code websites from scratch for small to medium sized businesses...but I actually end up doing much more than that.</p>

<p>From SEO (search engine optimisation), to setting up products on your eCommerce store and creating images for your blog posts.</p>

<p>Past the design and code though, at the heart of what I do is offer solutions to your business problems. A nice shiny new websites sound great, but I'm all about creating the right solution to help push your business to the next level, not just stick on a fresh coat of paint.</p>

							No. I create bespoke designs for all my clients. I have some base code I use for every project which greatly reduces set up time (ultimately reducing cost for you), but all styling and design elements are custom to each project.

						<p>
							As much as you'd like. I really enjoy working with my clients, not against them. My process is built to incorporate you as a huge part, since it's ultimately your business I'm offering my solutions to.

						<span class="accordion__opener"></span>
					</h3>
					<div class="accordion__content">
						<p>
							That's no problem at all. It happens rarely, but sometimes wires get crossed and things don't turn out as expected. I'm more than happy to work on the design until you've got something that will serve your business the best it can.

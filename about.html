## Who Am I?

<p class="txt-large">
	My name's Seb. I'm a web designer and developer based in Southampton, UK.
</p>

By day I'm the lead developer at a local agency. By night I spend my time working on freelance projects and building my own products.

My most recent product is called <a href="/calendi/">Calendi</a>, a simple editorial calendar for WordPress.

## My Process

### Getting Started

I have a standard process I try to apply to all projects, however, every project is slightly different, so itâ€™s not always 100% the same.

It usually all starts with an initial chat where we get to know each other. It also helps me understand what you're all about. From there I'll get you to fill in a brief so I can gather all the important details. I'll then send you a proposal and we can get going!

### Design & Development

Once the project is running, it starts off with wireframes and design as the first step.

When the design is signed off the project goes into development. From there I built the site into WordPress, Shopify or whatever tool we've decided is applicable to your project.

### Launch
After the site is built I'll give you as much tutoring as you'll need. This gives you full control over managing the site in the future. Then it gets launched.

The above is an abridged version. If you'd like more details on each step, please read my <a href="/process/">full process breakdown</a>.

## Why Work With Me?

There's nothing I enjoy more than designing and building good websites for nice people. It really is that simple.

Over the years I've come to figure out which types of projects I want to work on. Currently, I'm in the fortunate position of choosing what I do. If you're a small to medium sized business in need of a website refresh, I'm more than sure I can help.

If you fit the description then don't hesitate to <a href="/contact/">send me a message</a> and we can get to work!

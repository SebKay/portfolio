## Who I Am

<p class="txt-large">
	My name's Seb. I'm a web designer and developer based in Southampton, UK.
</p>

During the day I'm the lead developer at a local agency. During the evenings I spend my time working on freelance projects and building my own products.

My most recent project is called <a href="/calendi/">Calendi</a>. It's a simple yet powerful editorial calendar for WordPress.

## Why Work With Me

There's nothing I enjoy more than designing and developing good websites for nice people. It really is that simple.

I've spent many years trying to perfect what I do and while I'll never be perfect, I do my best to come close.

If you've got a project you'd like to work on with me just get in touch and we can get to work!

	The Brief
</h2>

Web design is a huge field to cover. It has many different paths and sectors, so you can’t just start a web design blog from scratch and expect the best results.

Instead of going into building Inspirational Pixels blind, I spent a lot of time researching what others were doing, and how they were doing it. The main questions I asked were:

- **Design and layout**: How are these sites laying out their content? Is there a common pattern? Can I improve upon what’s already there?
- **Content**: When do they publish content? What types of content do they publish?
- **Functionality**: This one is always tricky, because all sites are different and therefore require different features. Is there a common type of email subscriber area? Does each post have social sharing?

	What I Did
</h2>

To create something that would perfectly house the content, without suffocating it, I took a three-step approach:

1. Create a minimal design that doesn’t get in the way.
1. Plan out different content types and prepare analytics to see which ones work the best.
1. Create ways of “linking” content. For example, a related posts section or mentioning related content at the beginning of an article or tutorial.

My ideas started out as a sketches, where I planned the overall layout. It then went into a wireframe and slowly morphed into an initial design I could run with.

After the design was finished, I began coding a basic outline of the site. Starting with simple HTML/CSS pages and then slowly bringing in the WordPress functionality.

	The Result
</h2>

Although there were a few changes made after launch, the site you see today isn’t far from my initial concept.

The entire project has been a fantastic learning experience for me, in terms of web design, writing and marketing.

I still run the blog today, and am constantly finding new ways of providing more value to my readers.

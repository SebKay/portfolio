	The Brief
</h2>

I was really happy when Chargify’s director of marketing asked me to work with them to get what they had to the next level.

After a call over Skype, we talked about what they had and where to take it. They had a base for the new site and knew what they wanted, so it was my job get them there using my skills as both a designer and developer.

After the Skype call, we got to work on a Trello board to keep track of all the work. The main things we tracked were items **to-do**, **in-progress**, **completed** and **nice to haves** (which were things we wanted, but weren’t essential to the project).

	What I Did
</h2>

The first order of business, after organising all current tasks and goals in Trello, was to take stock of what was already in place. There had been a developer who made a start, but didn’t get them all the way.

Over the last six months, I’ve worked closely with a few of the guys at Chargify to primarily do two things, rework their site from the ground up and make it responsive.

The Chargify site gets a lot of traffic, with a large amount of new customers signing up everyday, so a lot of care was taken to make the experience of using the site painless as possible.

	The Result
</h2>

The new site is now mobile friendly, optimised to handle new sign ups and instills trust in a worthwhile brand.

I’ve heard from the marketing team that things have done nothing but increase since the new site went live, and the whole team loved it when they got a peek.

I’ve really enjoyed my time working with Chargify, and hope to continue working with them long into the future.

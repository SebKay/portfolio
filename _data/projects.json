The cards are dynamic change depending on what type of content they are. <br><br>Posts that are either tutorials or articles are tagged with a matching icon. Freebies show the file size at the bottom of the card and snippets show the code language the snippet is written in. <br><br>I also had the opportunity to rework the placement of the ads on the site. Before it was annoying to see ads plastered in the sidebar. Now in the redesign, the sidebar is gone and ads flow better in the overall design, yet are still obvious that they are advertisements."
